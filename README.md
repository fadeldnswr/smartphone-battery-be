# Smartphone Battery Backend Application
This project is backend application for my bachelor thesis project called *A Smartphone Useful Life Recommendation Based on State of Health Prediction, Remaining Useful Life Estimation and Broken Screen Detection to Mitigate Electronic Waste*

## Features
- /prediction/soh: State of Health prediction using LSTM
- /data-retrieval/raw-metrics: Raw metrics data retrieval (Voltage, Current, Temperature, Traffic, etc)
- /data-visualization/raw-metrics: Visualize raw metrics
- /data-visualization/app-usage: Visualize application usage by network data
- /graphs/metrics: Plot metrics graphs
- /graphs/summary: Plot application usage summaries
- /battery/metrics: Visualize battery metrics
- /image-prediction: Image classification using EfficientNet
- /impact/carbon-ewaste: Calculate carbon and electronic waste
